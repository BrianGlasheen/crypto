The Crypto-Grid app was developed as my 2019 CSP preformance task for the AP test. The CG has a few things you should know how to use. The input box takes an input in the form of argument=value, followed by a semicolon if there is another argument. The two main arguments are start and stop. These dictate the index range of the currencies to be displayed. Example good inputs: start=5, start=10;stop=15, stop=10;start=15. In the last example the program flips the lower-bound and upper-bound integers. The Update button is used to update the grid with the new arguments.
